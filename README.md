# 🎯 Handle Social  
**Built entirely using Google Workspace (Apps Script, Sheets, Drive, Sites)**

> **Own your social data. Get paid when brands use it.**

Handle Social is a concept application built to explore a powerful shift in the data economy:  
**your online identity has value — and you should be the one who benefits from it.**

Instead of letting platforms and advertisers quietly trade on your data for free, Handle Social puts the power back in your hands.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

Handle Social provides a centralized platform where you can:

- **Link & Verify Your Social Handles**  
  Confirm ownership across platforms and increase the value of your data.

- **Explore Marketplace Value**  
  See real-time “data rates” based on platform and verification status.

- **Monetize Verified Data**  
  Brands can request access to specific verified handles — and payments go **directly to you.**

- **Boost Your Earnings Over Time**  
  Improve your *Verifiability Score* to increase what brands will pay.

## 👥 Who It’s For

### **🧑‍💻 Data Owners (You!)**
Explore data value, connect your accounts, and watch your potential earnings grow through your dashboard.

### **🏢 Brands**
View anonymized ecosystem insights through the Brand View to understand what kinds of people follow which accounts — across platforms, not just in silos.

---

## 📬 Reach Out

Are you a brand that wants to truly understand who your customers follow across all platforms?  
People often look completely different on Instagram vs TikTok vs X — real understanding requires cross-platform intelligence.

Take a step toward understanding your audience on the same level algorithms already do — but ethically.
